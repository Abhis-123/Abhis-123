[{"content":"Introduction If you have ever taken an online course on Machine Learning, you must have come across Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction, or in simple terms, for compression of data. Guess what, I had taken such courses too but I never really understood the graphical significance of PCA because all I saw was matrices and equations. It took me quite a lot of time to understand this concept from various sources. So, I decided to compile it all in one place.\nIn this article, we will take a visual (graphical) approach to understand PCA and how it can be used to compress data. Basic knowledge of Linear Algebra and Matrices is assumed. If you are new to this concept, just follow along, I have tried my best to keep this as simple as possible.\nThese days, datasets containing a large number of dimensions are increasingly common and are often difficult to interpret. One example can be a database of face photographs of let’s say, 1,000,000 people. If each face photograph has a dimension of 100x100, then the data of each face is 10000 dimensional (there are 100x100 = 10,000 unique values to be stored for each face). Now, if 1 byte is required to store the information of each pixel, then 10,000 bytes are required to store 1 face. Since there are 1000 faces in the database,10,000 x 1,000,000 = 10 GB will be needed to store the dataset.\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets, exploiting the fact that the images in these datasets have something in common. For instance, in a dataset consisting of face photographs, each photograph will have facial features like eyes, nose, mouth. Instead of encoding this information pixel by pixel, we could make a template of each type of these features and then just combine these templates to generate any face in the dataset. In this approach, each template will still be 100x100 = 1000 dimensional, but since we will be reusing these templates (basis functions) to generate each face in the dataset, the number of templates required will be very small. PCA does exactly this.\nHow does PCA work? This part is going to be a bit technical, so bear with me! I will try to explain the working of PCA with a simple example. Let’s consider the data shown below containing 100 points each 2 dimensional (x \u0026amp; y coordinates is needed to represent each point).\nCurrently, we are using 2 values to represent each point. Let’s explain this situation in a more technical way. We are currently using 2 basis functions,x as (1, 0) and y as (0, 1). Each point in the dataset is represented as a weighted sum of these basis functions. For instance, point (2, 3) can be represented as 2(1, 0) + 3(0, 1) = (2, 3). If we omit either of these basis functions, we will not be able to represent the points in the dataset accurately. Therefore, both the dimensions necessary, and we can’t just drop one of them to reduce the storage requirement. This set of basis functions is actually the cartesian coordinate in 2 dimensions.\nIf we notice closely, we can very well see that the data approximates a line as shown by the red line below.\nNow, let’s rotate the coordinate system such that the x-axis lies along the red line. Then, the y-axis (green line) will be perpendicular to this red line. Let’s call these new x and y axes as a-axis and b-axis respectively. This is shown below.\nNow, if we use a and b as the new set basis functions (instead of using x and y) for this dataset, it wouldn’t be wrong to say that most of the variance in the dataset is along the a-axis. Now, if we drop the b-axis, we can still represent the points in the dataset very accurately, using just a-axis. Therefore, we now only need half as must storage to store the dataset and reconstruct it accurately. This is exactly how PCA works.\nPCA is a 4 step process. Starting with a dataset containing n dimensions (requiring n-axes to be represented):\nFind a new set of basis functions (naxes) where some axes contribute to most of the variance in the dataset while others contribute very little. Arrange these axes in the decreasing order of variance contribution. Now, pick the top k axes to be used and drop the remaining n-k axes. Now, project the dataset onto these k axes. After these 4 steps, the dataset will be compressed from n-dimensions to just k-dimensions (k\u0026lt;n).\nSteps For the sake of simplicity, let’s take the above dataset and apply PCA on that. The steps involved will be technical and basic knowledge of linear algebra is assumed.\nStep 1 Since this is a 2-dimensional dataset, n=2. The first step is to find the new set of basis functions (a \u0026amp; b). In the explanation above, we saw that the dataset had the maximum variance along a line and we manually chose that line as a-axis and the line the perpendicular to it as b-axis. In practice, we want this step to be automated.\nTo accomplish this, we can find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the dataset. Since the dataset is 2 dimensional, we will get 2 eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors. Then, the 2 eigenvectors are two basis functions (new axes) and the two eigenvalues tell us the variance contribution of the corresponding eigenvectors. A large value of eigenvalue implies that the corresponding eigenvector (axis) contributes more towards the total variance of the dataset.\nStep 2 Now, sort the eigenvectors (axes) according to decreasing eigenvalues. Here, we can see that the eigenvalue for a-axis is much larger than that of theb-axis meaning that a-axis contributes more towards the dataset variance.\nThe percentage contribution of each axis towards the total dataset variance can be calculated as:\nThe above numbers prove that the a-axis contributes 99.7% towards the dataset variance and that we can drop the b-axis and lose just 0.28% of the variance.\nStep 3 Now, we will drop the b-axis and keep only the a-axis.\nStep 4 Now, reshape the first eigenvector (a-axis) into a 2x1 matrix, called the projection matrix. It will be used to project the original dataset of shape(100, 2) onto the new basis function (a-axis), thus compressing it to (100, 1).\nReconstruct the data Now, we can use the projection matrix to expand the data back to its original size, with of course a small loss of variance (0.28%).\nThe reconstructed data is shown below:\nPlease note that the variance along the b-axis (0.28%) is lost as evident by the above figure.\nThat’s all folks! If you made it till here, hats off to you! In this article, we took a graphical approach to understand how Principal Component Analysis works and how it can be used for data compression.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/blog/pca-visualized/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have ever taken an online course on Machine Learning, you must have come across Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction, or in simple terms, for compression of data.

I also gave a glimpse of my revision notes that I prepared while taking the course and practice exams on Udemy. After that video was out, I got so many comments and DMs, requesting me to share my notes, but the problem was that I took these notes using a note-taking app called Obsidian which stores them in markdown format locally on my Mac. Once I\u0026rsquo;m done editing my notes, I push them to a GitHub repository to make sure I don\u0026rsquo;t lose them if my laptop breaks.\nSo, if you want to view my notes exactly like I do, you can clone my Obsidian Vault repository and download Obsidian to render it. But, this solution isn\u0026rsquo;t elegant as it would require you to download an additional software. So, I along with my college roommate, Sarthak Narayan, had been working over the past 2 weeks on the project, Obsidian Publish using GitHub Action, which would allow us to effortlessly publish our notes as a static website.\nIt is complete and I\u0026rsquo;ve used it to publish my notes at notes.arkalim.org. Working The GitHub Action spins up a Docker container which parses and converts Obsidian markdown notes into a special markdown format understood by MkDocs, an open-source static site generator. MkDocs is actually meant for preparing documentations but works well for notes too. After the markdown files have been converted, all the images in my notes are compressed to a fraction of their original size so that they can load quickly in your web browser. A static site is then built using MkDocs and then finally deployed on Netlify. All of this happens automatically using GitHub Actions. All I have to do is update my notes and push the changes to GitHub.\nFinal thoughts Having an automated way to publish your notes online with the community is a powerful way to share knowledge. This project has also made it exceedingly easy for me to refer my notes from anywhere, which is powerful when you work on a lot of systems.\nResources My Notes Obsidian Publish - GitHub Action Parser and Image Compressor MkDocs - Material Theme ","permalink":"//localhost:1313/projects/obsidian-publish-github-action/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"intro\"\u003eIntro\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my video about \u003ca href=\"https://arkalim.org/blog/aws-saa-certification/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow I cleared the AWS SAA Certification Exam\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, I shared my preparation strategy as well as tips to ace the exam.
