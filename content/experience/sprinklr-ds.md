### Description

- Managed end-to-end training, testing, and deployment of sentiment analysis and moderation services, including emotion detection and spam filtering.
- Fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) such as LLaMA3-8B, Phi3, LLaMA7B, and Mistral7B for task-specific applications in Generalized Classification and text analysis using techniques like LoRA, QLoRa, and SFT.
- Developed and implemented prompting techniques (CoT, BoT, and RAG) to address the instruction adherence problem in LLMs.
- Employed optimization techniques (pruning, quantization, efficient decoding, prompt compression) to reduce memory usage by 60-70% and achieved 2x inference speed.
- Created domain and task-oriented datasets for fine-tuning, enhancing instruction adherence and minimizing hallucinations in models.
